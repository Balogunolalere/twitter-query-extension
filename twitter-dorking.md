How to Use Twitter Search Operators

Twitter has several search filters for tweets. Although the advanced search panel may look complex, it‚Äôs easy to use once you know the search operators.

X / Twitter advanced search operators overview 

Twitter advanced search operators help to find specific old tweets on X. The search result might either include or exclude specific words in the text, mentions, hashtags, etc. We cover all possible Twitter search commands in the next sections.

Sometimes you don‚Äôt need to analyze the whole amount of tweets shared with a hashtag to understand what happened. May be you just want to analyze the tweets sent in a specific language or by some users in particular. Sometimes you might need to summarize your search in order to make the most out of all the data. In this post we are going to go through some of the most useful Twitter advanced search filters.

How to search tweets for specific hashtags, keywords, or phrases
All of these words: To find tweets with a certain set of keywords, enter two or more words. For example, you could search for ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù and ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù to find tweets with both terms in any order.
This exact phrase: Search for specific phrases or even entire sentences.
Any of these words: Search for two or more words at once. For example, you could enter ‚Äú@TweetBinder,‚Äù ‚ÄúTweet Binder,‚Äùand ‚Äú#tweetbinder‚Äù to search for all things related to our Twitter analytics platform. All tweets will contain one or more of these words.
These hashtags: To find tweets that include certain hashtags, simply enter one or more of them. For example, you could search for ‚Äú#TweetBinder.‚Äù
How to exclude tweets from search results
None of these words: To narrow your search results, enter one or more search terms to filter out tweets that include the words or phrases you specify.
Twitter ‚Äì advanced search settings for words
How to search tweets by user
From these accounts: With this field, you can easily search Twitter by user (e.g. from:TweetBinder).
To these accounts: This operator shows replies to a certain username (e.g. to:TweetBinder).
Mentioning these accounts: Along with searching tweets by user, you can find posts mentioning any user (e.g. (@tweetbinder) ).

How to search tweets by language
Language: Narrow your search results by language. From the dropdown list, select any of the nearly three dozen languages that Twitter supports (Tweet Binder lang:en).
How to search tweets by country, city or location
Near: The Twitter search panel has a location filter, but it‚Äôs very basic. Check the box to see only tweets posted ‚ÄúNear you.‚Äù To find X posts from users in specific locations, use the search operator (near:[location]) (e.g. near:Madrid).
Within: Add a city and a distance if you want local info. (e.g. near:Madrid within:10mi)
Twitter ‚Äì search filters for location

How to search tweets by date
Dates: To do an X search for certain time periods, use Twitter‚Äôs date settings. By setting ‚Äúsince:YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äù and ‚Äúuntil:YYYY-MM-DD‚Äù dates, searching tweets by date is possible for a single day or for a multi-month or -year period. For example, you can see what users said during a campaign, event, or viral moment.

How to search by tweet content
Links: By default, Twitter searches show tweets with links. You can switch this option off so the search doesn‚Äôt show tweets with links, or you can opt to show only tweets with links (e.g. ‚ÄúTweet Binder‚Äù filter:links).
Images: This X search will show old tweets with images (e.g. ‚ÄúTweet Binder‚Äù filter:images) or without images (e.g. ‚ÄúTweet Binder‚Äù -filter:images).
Media: This X search will show old tweets with any media such as images, videos or gifs (e.g. ‚ÄúTweet Binder‚Äù filter:media) or without it (e.g. ‚ÄúTweet Binder‚Äù -filter:media).
How to find top tweets
Min_retweets: Shows tweets with minimum number of retweets (e.g. from:tweetbinder min_retweets:1000).
Min_faves: Shows tweets with minimum number of likes (e.g. from:tweetbinder min_faves:1000).
Min_replies: Shows tweets with minimum number of replies (e.g. from:tweetbinder min_replies:1000).
How to search tweet replies vs original tweets
Replies: By default, all advanced searches show both replies and original posts. You have the option to see only original posts or replies (e.g. (from:tweetbinder) -filter:replies).
Original tweets: if you want to exclude replies from you search use the following operator ‚Äúfilter:replies‚Äù (e.g. from:tweetbinder filter:replies).

What can we search on Twitter? The answer is actually pretty simple: anything. Twitter advanced search is the way of obtaining very concrete results on Twitter. There are some basic Twitter search operators which are helpful if you are looking for hashtags, terms, accounts or links.

But there are also many others which make it easier to find tweets by date, by type, by language, etc. These Twitter search operators can also be used when using Tweet Binder. This is a way of creating a very useful and concrete report.

All these operators can be combined. You can try all these Twitter advanced commands in the search box below. Analyse any hashtag, keyword or mention on Twitter / X. Up to 200 tweets from the last 7 days.

Best Twitter Searcher Tools

While you can certainly use Twitter as a search engine, there are some drawbacks to the native tool:

It isn‚Äôt possible to do a Twitter search without an account or to search Twitter without logging in.
Twitter searches only display tweets and profiles‚Äînot stats or insights related to the search.

With the right third-party Twitter search tool, you can access stats from Twitter and save or download in-depth reports.

Tweet Binder ‚Äì best old tweet searcher for X

Tweet Binder provides access to historical tweets with no time limitation. To get access to tweets since 2006 you need a Twitter account to login to Tweet Binder.

However, if you need to search X without a Twitter profile with Tweet Binder you can search up to 200 tweets from the last 7 days free of charge. 

As a result, it‚Äôs possible to do a free Twitter search without login using the search bar below and search commands you just learned.

However, Tweet Binder is much more than an advanced Twitter search engine. It also provides Twitter stats that you can use to analyze tweets, profiles, and trends.

17 Smart Ways to Use Twitter Advanced Search

Now you know how to look up old tweets and how to search someone‚Äôs tweets. 

So how can you get insights from these search results? Here are 17 use cases for Twitter advanced search.

1. Get Twitter historical data

You can find old Tweets using Twitter‚Äôs advanced search panel. But if you want to analyze past marketing campaigns‚Äô Twitter stats, it‚Äôs a good idea to use Tweet Binder, as it shows stats back to 2006.

Using Twitter advanced search operators on Tweet Binder, you can analyze tweets from any account with no date limitation. This means that you can look for tweets since 2006.

For example, let‚Äôs take a look at Barack Obama‚Äôs tweets. He opened his Twitter account back in March 2007, we can create a report that goes back there and we can analyze all his tweets (all those that were sent by him). Take a look at the historical report for Barack Obama‚Äôs Twitter account:

This is how Obama tweeted since 2007 until 2019. Twitter search from:barackobama

You can view, download, and analyze this Twitter historical data. Then you can measure the full impact of the user or Twitter marketing campaign using the tweet activity, engagement, sentiment, and contributor stats.

Related reading ‚Äì Learn how to download an archive of your data.

2. Find tweets from a particular account or person

To search someone‚Äôs tweets you just have to use the ‚Äúfrom:‚Äù command. For example, if you want to see the tweets that Katy Perry shares you have to write:

from:katyperry

You can combine this command with a keyword for example. If you want to see the tweets where Katy Perry adds #CozyLittleChristmas, we write:

from:katyperry #CozyLittleChristmas

Twitter advanced search allows you to find tweets from any public account. You can or do a Twitter archive search for any public profile whether it‚Äôs a business, person, or government entity. For example, you can search your competitor‚Äôs tweets using the ‚Äúfrom:‚Äù search operator:

from:AudienseCo

Keep in mind that this search will show all original tweets and replies by your competitor. To see only replies, use the ‚Äúfilter:‚Äù search operator:

from:AudienseCo filter:replies

To see only original tweets, add the ‚Äú-‚Äù search operator in front of ‚Äúfilter:‚Äù to exclude replies:

from:AudienseCo -filter:replies

To narrow the time frame for the search, add date filters:

Tweet Binder ‚Äì find tweets from any Twitter profile

3. Find interactions between Twitter accounts

It‚Äôs possible to see a complete history of the relationship between any two Twitter accounts. To build a tweet finder that shows direct interactions between Twitter accounts, use the ‚Äúfrom:‚Äù and ‚Äúto:‚Äù operators:

from:TweetBinder to:fjabrego

Note that using the ‚Äúto:‚Äù search operator shows replies only. To find both replies and mentions between two accounts, use the ‚Äúto:‚Äù and ‚Äú@‚Äù operators:

from:TweetBinder to:fjabrego OR @fjabrego

This search type is helpful for spotting interaction trends, revealing relationship sentiment, and adding up total tweet volume. It can also provide more context for relationships with influencers and customers.

4. Find tweets on a specific topic

Advanced Twitter searches can display tweets about a certain topic from any account. To search for a topic or phrase, use quotes to define the search term:

‚ÄúTwitter analytics‚Äù

A search like the one above will show historical data for the specific topic or phrase. But with the right Twitter search advanced operators, you can do more in-depth research.

For example, you can get ideas for using Twitter analytics by adding ‚Äúhow to‚Äù to the query:

‚Äúhow to‚Äù ‚ÄúTwitter analytics‚Äù

Keep in mind that searching for more than one exact phrase can seriously limit your search results. Consider using ‚ÄúAND‚Äù or ‚ÄúOR‚Äù operators to broaden the results and find more ideas:

‚ÄúAND‚Äù displays results that use both terms.
‚ÄúOR‚Äù displays results that use either term.
Tweet Binder ‚Äì find tweets on a specific topic

5. Use Twitter search as a listening tool

Because advanced Twitter searches can get so specific, you can use them to listen for certain topics or keywords. For example, you can find out how people are talking about your brand or other solutions in your category.

In this case, you‚Äôll want to add questions like ‚Äúhow do you‚Äù or ‚Äúrecommendations for‚Äù to the search query:

‚Äúrecommendations for‚Äù Twitter AND tool

When you search tweets, date filters can help you find more relevant results. By adding a date range to the query, you can focus on what users have recommended recently:

‚Äúrecommendations for‚Äù Twitter AND tool since:2023-01-01 until:2023-06-30

6. Find viral tweets that are popular

By default, Twitter searches show all relevant tweets, even if they had zero impressions or engagement. However, it‚Äôs easy to search for tweets that are popular or even viral.

All you have to do is decide on your own definition of popular tweets. For example, say you only want to see tweets with at least 100 retweets:

from:TweetBinder min_retweets:100

You can add other engagement metrics to the search query too. For example, say you want to see tweets with 100 retweets, 100 replies, and 100 likes:

from:TweetBinder min_replies:100 min_faves:100 min_retweets:100

Tweet Binder ‚Äì social listening search

This advanced search is great for finding your own top tweets, based on your specific criteria. It‚Äôs also helpful for analyzing popular tweets from any public account or find your top tweets.

7. Search Twitter hashtags and check their stats

With a Twitter hashtag search, it‚Äôs possible to monitor trends and analyze conversations. Keep your search simple to see all posts on the topic, like in this example:

#AbuDhabiGP 

Alternatively, add other search terms to narrow the results. For example, you can create a tweet hashtag search that also includes single words or exact phrases:

Tweet Binder ‚Äì Twitter hashtag search

Tweet Binder reports offer in-depth stats and insights into hashtag tracking performance. In addition to impressions and engagement, they chart hashtag activity over time and calculate the economic value of the hashtag campaign. Try Twitter search for free.

8. Find top tweeters on any topic

With Tweet Binder reports, it‚Äôs easy to see the top tweeters on any topic or for any account. The contributors section of these reports shows the top accounts in terms of:

Overall activity
Original tweets
Impressions
Favorites
Retweets
Replies
Popularity (i.e., most followers)
Tweet Binder ‚Äì top tweeters search

Using these insights, you can find the most active and the most influential Twitter users on any topic. As a result, you can find relevant influencers and identify people to add to your Twitter community.

9. Search Twitter influencers, creators, journalists, and clients

With an advanced free Twitter bio searcher, use the combination of keywords and locations to find Twitter users.  You can find creators, influencers, journalists, and even customers using Audiense Connect‚Äòs free search tool.

It searches for keywords in users username and bio, not the content of their tweets. For example:

Audiense Connect ‚Äì Twitter bio search

Use the filters in the left navigation to define the types of accounts you want to see. For example, you can opt to view active accounts that tweet at least 5x per day and have a follower ratio of at least 2.

Audiense Connect ‚Äì Twitter user search in bio

Then you can build your community and grow Twitter followers strategically.

10. Monitor any user mentions on Twitter / X

It‚Äôs also possible to use Twitter advanced search as a social media monitoring tool. You can monitor mentions of your own account or any other Twitter user.

To find mentions, use the ‚Äú@‚Äù operator and input the username in brackets. For example, we can search for Tweet Binder mentions with this search:

(@TweetBinder)

Standard Tweet Binder reports show historical mentions, either over the past seven days or over the past several years. However, Tweet Binder also offers real-time trackers.

With a real-time tracker, you can set up a Twitter monitor that detects mentions as they happen. It‚Äôs ideal for monitoring accounts during important campaigns or critical events and adjusting your strategy in real time.

11. Search Twitter followers

Audiense Connect is also a powerful tool for searching your existing audience. Here‚Äôs how to search Twitter followers: navigate to your community wall and enter a query.

Use advanced syntax to structure your search.

Audiense Connect ‚Äì advanced syntax search

Learning how to search followers on Twitter for your own account is just the first step. You can also evaluate other users‚Äô followers, as long as you‚Äôve added them as third-party accounts in Audiense Connect.

Then you can analyze the types of users following your account, your competitors, or influencers in your niche. You can also understand their audience makeup and find valuable accounts to follow and engage.

Related reading ‚Äì the Ultimate Guide to Twitter Follower Audit.

12. Find the most liked tweet or the most retweeted tweet

Whether you‚Äôre researching a specific account, keyword, or hashtag, you can easily find the single most popular tweet for any query. All Tweet Binder reports automatically display the most liked and the most retweeted tweet. It allows you to find the most popular tweets from an account.

Tweet Binder ‚Äì most liked and retweeted tweets

You can use these stats to better understand the campaign or the audience. When you know what‚Äôs likely to get the most engagement, you can improve your own Twitter marketing strategy.

13. Filter by a specific type of tweet

By default, Twitter searches include text, link, and image tweets. To narrow the results, use ‚Äúfilter:‚Äù search operators and define the type of tweet you want to see.

For example, you can search for only tweets with links:

from:TweetBinder filter:links

You can also do a Twitter image search to find only tweets with images:

from:TweetBinder filter:images

Using ‚Äú-‚Äù search operators, you can also exclude tweets with media or links:

X search

These advanced search options can locate specific tweets in your own Twitter search history. The operators also work for other accounts, so you can find specific tweets for any account.

14. Find tweets from a date or a particular time period

On twitter advanced search, to filter tweets by date use the commands SINCE and UNTIL  followed by ‚Äú:‚Äù and the period of time you want to analyze. You can combine both and also you can use them with other commands.

To set the beginning of the search period, use ‚Äúsince‚Äù:

to:TweetBinder since:2023-11-01

To set the end of the search period, use ‚Äúuntil‚Äù:

to:TweetBinder until:2023-11-15

To establish a date range, use both ‚Äúsince‚Äù and ‚Äúuntil‚Äù:

Tweet Binder ‚Äì filter tweets by date range

Some other X search examples:

@Netflix since:yyyy-mm-dd (tweets since a certain day)
@tweetbinder until:yyyy-mm-dd (tweets until a certain day)
‚Äúanalytical tool‚Äù since:yyyy-mm-dd until:yyyy-mm-dd (tweets between certain dates)

YYYY will be the year, mm the month and dd the day. So for the first option, if we want to analyze tweets that mention @Netflix since the 8th of November we will write on the search box: @Netflix since:2021-11-08.

15. Find tweets by location, country or city

If you‚Äôre marketing a local business or running a local campaign, you can find more relevant content by filtering tweets by location. This way it is possible to search tweets from a specific country

There are two ways to add location filters to an old tweet finder.

One way is using the ‚Äúnear‚Äù search operator, which defines a city, region, country, postal codes, or even GPS coordinates. For example:

‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs World Cup‚Äù near:US

You should use the country codes, you can find them here in this link.

If you want to create a report with tweets from a specific city you can use the same command and add the name of the city. For example, if we want to create a report with tweets sent from Detroit the query will be:

‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs World Cup‚Äù near:Madrid

In addition, use the ‚Äúwithin‚Äù search operator, which defines a radius around a specific location. For example:

‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs World Cup‚Äù near:Madrid within:25km

16. Find tweets by language

By default, Twitter searches display tweets in all languages. To show tweets in language of interest, use the ‚Äúlang:‚Äù search operator:

‚ÄúTweet Binder‚Äù lang:en

With Tweet Binder, you can also create separate reports for different languages. This option is helpful for understanding the volume and sentiment for topics or accounts in various languages.

For example, you may find that there are far more tweets in a certain language about a topic relevant to your business. These insights can inform your Twitter marketing strategy and help you decide whether to offer support or launch a dedicated account in that language.

17. Discover the sentiment around specific topics 

Do customers, influencers, and community members have a positive or negative feeling about a topic or account? With sentiment data, you can easily discover the answer.

Tweet Binder‚Äôs sentiment chart offers an overview of the positive, negative, or neutral sentiment for the account or topic.

Tweet Binder ‚Äì Twitter sentiment score

It breaks down sentiment by tweets, contributors, and impressions so you can better understand the impact of the sentiment. It also shows a timeline for the entire report period so you can see if and how the sentiment changed over time.

Tweet Binder ‚Äì Twitter sentiment timeline

Did the sentiment shift from positive to negative over time? If you can pinpoint the event or tweet that caused the change, you can better understand the topic and how to engage the audience.
